[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KenjiTakahashi/pacmixer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KenjiTakahashi/pacmixer)

**pacmixer** is an [alsamixer][alsamixer] alike for PulseAudio.

I started this, because I've found no full-blown, terminal based mixers available for PA. All there are are either [CLI][CLI] or some kinds of GNOME/KDE applets. That's not what I wanted, so in the end I decided to go for it myself.

It was also a good starting point to finally learn myself some ObjC :).

Back in the old days, there were a good mixer for ALSA (alsamixer), so I thought about taking some of their ideas, mix it with mine, and see what happens.

**Updating past 0.5:** Configuration mechanism has been reworked to be more flexible and integrate better with GNU/Linux environment. It means that:

* Pacmixer configuration is no longer available through settings tab (it is reserved for PA options).
* Settings are now configured using [configuration file](https://github.com/KenjiTakahashi/pacmixer#configuration).
* Settings configured with version <= 0.5 will be reset to defaults after update.
* Settings storage follows XDG => No more creepy "GNUStep" directory.

## requirements
* libpulse
* ncurses
* gnustep-base
* gcc-objc (for compilation)
* ninja (for compilation)

## installation
```sh
# ./mk install
```

## usage
**Note:** There is also an introductory video available [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3qk_Fn1Yeo), thanks to [**@gotbletu**](https://github.com/gotbletu).

**Note:** `man pacmixer` is your friend now as well.

**pacmixer** comes with built-in help, but here's the shortcuts reference, just in case.

```
h (or Left): Moves to the previous control.
l (or Right): Moves to the next control.
k (or Up): Increases the volume standardly.
K (or Shift+Up): Increases the volume fastly.
j (or Down): Decreases the volume standardly.
J (or Shift+Down): Decreases the volume fastly.
m: Mutes the volume.
d: Sets as default.
i: Enters inside mode.
s: Enters settings mode.
o: Toggles options dialog.
q (or Esc): Exits settings/inside mode or exit the application.
F1-F5 (or 1-5): Switches to All/Playback/Recording/Outputs/Inputs view, respectively.
F12 (or 0): Switches to Settings view.
```

#### settings view
Used to change card wise settings (e.g. profiles).

```
h (or Left): Moves to the previous group of settings.
l (or Right): Moves to the next group of settings.
k (or Up): Moves to the previous setting within group.
j (or Down): Moves to the next setting within group.
space: (Un)checks highlighted setting.
q (or Esc): Exits the application.
```

#### inside mode
Used to adjust specific channel's volume.

All shortcuts (besides `q`) work the same, except that they affect single channel instead of the whole sink/source.

#### settings mode
Used to change controls settings (e.g. ports).

Shortcuts work like in outside mode, except that:

* `space` is used to check setting.
* `h` and `l` iterate only over controls which actually have settings.

## configuration
Pacmixer uses [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) based configuration file stored in either `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pacmixer/settings.toml` or `$HOME/.config/pacmixer/settings.toml`.

When run for the first time, it will create a new file with all configuration options set to their defaults. You can use this file as a basis and/or checkout the reference below.

**[Display]**

`StartScreen` (string) - Sets which screen should be visible when starting pacmixer. Available values are "All", "Playback", "Recording", "Outputs", "Inputs" and "Settings".

**[Control]**

`UpSpeed` (integer) - Sets the speed of the standard volume up command.

`FastUpSpeed` (integer) - Sets the speed of the fast volume up command.

`DownSpeed` (integer) - Sets the speed of the standard volume down command.

`FastDownSpeed` (integer) - Sets the speed of the standard volume down command.

**[Filter]**

`Monitors` (boolean) - Filters out Monitor controls.

`Internals` (boolean) - Filters out PA internal controls.

`Options` (boolean) - Filters out Options part of the controls.

**[Log]**

`Dir` (string) - Directory where log file(s) will be stored. Leave empty string to disable logging.

## something's broken?

Please include the log file (`$HOME/.local/share/pacmixer/pacmixer.log` by default) with your bug report.

If it crashes hard (i.e. SEGFAULTS), it might also be useful to compile in debug mode and run through `gdb` to retrieve stacktrace.

```sh
$ ./mk debug
$ gdb ./pacmixer
gdb$ run
gdb$ bt
```

That will make it easier to identify the problem.

## tests

Type
```sh
$ ./mk tests
$ ./pacmixer_run_tests
```

**Note:** It is a [Catch][catch] executable, all [options] apply.
